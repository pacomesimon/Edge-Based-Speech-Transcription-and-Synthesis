## Credit: The code used in this folder has been borrowed from [github.com/ShivamRajSharma/Transformer-Text-To-Speech/](https://github.com/ShivamRajSharma/Transformer-Text-To-Speech/) repository. The purpose was to let us focus on our contribution: The cascading architecture, by building on what has been already done. This also shows that any existing model can easily adapt to the proposed cascading architecture, as long as output from inner layers can be accessed.
